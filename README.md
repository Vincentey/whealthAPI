# Whealth API – Telemedicine API Documentation Project

The **Whealth API** is a telemedicine backend API I created to showcase my technical writing skills — particularly in API documentation — as a developer who also writes. This project demonstrates my ability to design, build, and document real-world APIs for potential clients and employers.

##  Features

The current version of the API includes:

- User authentication for doctors and patients
- Registration and login endpoints
- Profile setup, viewing, and editing

##  Endpoints (Implemented)

- `POST /auth/register` – Register a new user
- `POST /auth/login` – Log in an existing user
- `POST /profile/setup` – Complete user profile
- `GET /profile` – View profile details
- `PUT /profile/edit` – Edit profile information

##  In Progress

I'm currently solo-developing the following features:
- Appointment and consultation scheduling
- Virtual meeting integration
- Payment processing

##  Purpose

This project serves as a portfolio piece to illustrate my capabilities in:
- Backend development using Node.js and Express
- Writing clear, developer-friendly API documentation in OpenAPI (YAML)
- Designing RESTful APIs for telemedicine use cases
