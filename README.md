# Whealth API – Telemedicine API Documentation Project

The **Whealth API** is a telemedicine API that features login and registration for patient and doctors, appointment scheduling, virtual consultation and payment. 

##  Features

The current version of the API includes:

- User authentication for doctors and patients
- Registration and login endpoints
- Profile setup, viewing, and editing

##  Endpoints (Implemented)

- `POST /auth/register` – Register a new user (https://github.com/Vincentey/whealthAPI/blob/main/API%20documentation/authentication.md)
- `POST /auth/login` – Log in an existing user (https://github.com/Vincentey/whealthAPI/blob/main/API%20documentation/authentication.md)
- `POST /profilesetup` – Complete user profile
- `GET /profileView` – View profile details
- `PUT /profileEdit` – Edit profile information

##  In Progress

I'm currently solo-developing the following features:
- Appointment and consultation scheduling
- Virtual meeting integration
- Payment processing

##  Purpose

This project serves as a portfolio piece to illustrate my capabilities in:
- Backend development using Node.js and Express
- Writing clear, developer-friendly API documentation in OpenAPI (YAML)
- Designing RESTful APIs for telemedicine use cases
